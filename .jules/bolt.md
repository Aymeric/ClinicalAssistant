## 2026-10-24 - Fast-path direct numeric parsing before regex evaluation
**Learning:** In Flutter/Dart apps processing large collections of health metrics, running `RegExp.hasMatch` on every record value before attempting `double.tryParse` creates regex execution overhead across rendering, signal analysis, and trend calculation hot loops.
**Action:** Always attempt `double.tryParse` first for standard numeric values, and reserve grouped number regex pattern matching for inputs that actually contain commas.
